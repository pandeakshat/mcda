# Criteria Weighting Methods in Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)

## Overview
Criteria weighting in MCDA assigns numerical values (weights) to different criteria based on their relative importance, aiding decision-makers in prioritizing objectives and balancing trade-offs effectively.

## Importance of Criteria Weighting
- Balances conflicting objectives
- Enhances decision transparency
- Reduces bias and arbitrariness
- Ensures consistency in decisions

## Classification of Weighting Approaches
### Subjective Approach
- Relies on expert judgment, preferences, and opinions.

### Objective Approach
- Uses data-driven methods independent of subjective opinions.

### Hybrid Approach
- Integrates both subjective and objective techniques.

## Subjective Weighting Methods

### Direct Assignment Methods
- **Point Allocation Method:** Decision-makers allocate points (fixed total) to criteria.
- **Simple Direct Weighting:** Decision-makers freely assign numerical importance to criteria, normalized to sum up to 1.
- **Fixed Ratio Method:** Criteria importance is assigned relative to a chosen reference criterion.

### Ranking-Based Methods
- **Rank Sum Method (RSM):** Weights based on inverse ranking order.
- **Rank Order Centroid (ROC):** Converts rankings into weights using a mathematical formula.
- **Equal Weighting (Uniform Method):** Assumes equal importance for all criteria.

### Pairwise Comparison Methods
- **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP):** Pairwise comparisons with consistency checks.
- **Best-Worst Method (BWM):** Identifies best and worst criteria, reduces comparisons and improves consistency.
- **Swing Weighting:** Weights based on improvement from worst to best levels.
- **MACBETH:** Uses qualitative judgments (weak, strong) converted to numerical scales.
- **Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA):** Sequentially ranks criteria and adjusts weights stepwise.

### Group Decision-Making Methods
- **Delphi Method:** Iterative expert consensus through anonymous feedback.
- **Consensus-Based Weighting:** Aggregates individual weights through structured consensus mechanisms.
- **Social Choice Theory Methods:** 
  - **Borda Count:** Ranks converted to scores; highest score receives highest weight.
  - **Condorcet Method:** Pairwise criteria comparisons; winners determined by majority preference.
  - **Majority Judgment Method:** Uses median ratings across decision-makers.
  - **Approval Voting-Based Weighting:** Based on criteria approvals from decision-makers.

## Objective Weighting Methods

### Entropy-Based Methods
- **Shannon Entropy Method:** Weights based on criteria variability; higher variability equals higher weight.

### Statistical & Variance-Based Methods
- **CRITIC Method:** Combines criteria variability and correlation to assign weights.
- **Coefficient of Variation (CV) Method:** Weights based on relative variability of criteria.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Weighting:** Uses PCA to derive weights from variance explained by principal components.
- **Factor Analysis Weighting:** Uses Factor Analysis to identify latent structures and assign weights.

## Hybrid Weighting Methods
- Combine subjective (expert opinions) and objective (data-driven) methods for robust weighting schemes.
- Examples: AHP-Entropy, Fuzzy AHP, BWM-Entropy.

## Practical Considerations
- **Consistency Checks:** Verify consistency (e.g., AHP's CR).
- **Robustness:** Conduct sensitivity analysis to understand weight impacts.
- **Scalability:** Ensure methods handle numerous criteria efficiently.

## Selecting Appropriate Weighting Methods
| Scenario | Recommended Method |
|----------|--------------------|
| Strong expert preferences | AHP, BWM, MACBETH |
| Data-driven contexts | Entropy, CRITIC, PCA |
| Consensus decisions | Delphi, Consensus-Based, Borda Count |
| Mixed subjective/objective needs | Hybrid methods (AHP-Entropy, BWM-Entropy) |

## Conclusion
Selecting suitable weighting methods is essential for effective MCDA. The method should align with the decision context, available data, and desired balance between subjective judgment and objective analysis. Combining methods and performing sensitivity analyses further enhance decision robustness.
