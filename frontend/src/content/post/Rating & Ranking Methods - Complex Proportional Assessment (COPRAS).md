# Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS)

## Overview
The **Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS)** method is a multi-criteria decision analysis tool that ranks alternatives based on their proportional contributions across beneficial and non-beneficial criteria. COPRAS evaluates alternatives by combining weighted and normalized criteria scores into a comprehensive proportional score.

## Inputs
- **Alternatives:** Entities such as firms, banks, cities, or countries.
- **Criteria:** Measures used to evaluate alternatives (financial, sustainability, economic).
- **Attributes:** Values linked to each criterion, categorized as:
  - **Beneficial (maximize)**
  - **Non-beneficial (minimize)**

## Steps

### Step 1: Criteria Weighting
Assign weights reflecting criteria importance, ensuring total weights equal 1.

### Step 2: Data Normalization
Normalize performances:
- All criteria (beneficial and non-beneficial) are normalized by dividing each score by the sum of scores for that criterion across all alternatives.

### Step 3: Compute COPRAS Scores
Calculate COPRAS scores, which combine performance on beneficial and non-beneficial criteria:
- Higher COPRAS scores indicate better alternatives, reflecting higher contributions from beneficial criteria and lower impacts from non-beneficial criteria.

### Step 4: Compute Utility Values
Calculate utility values for each alternative relative to the best-performing alternative:
- Utility = (Alternative COPRAS Score / Highest COPRAS Score) × 100%
- Higher utility values indicate preferable alternatives.

### Step 5: Ranking Alternatives
Rank alternatives from best to worst based on descending utility values.

## Implementation Decisions
- **Normalization Methods:** Vector Normalization, Linear Scale Transformation (Max-Min, Max, Sum), Non-monotonic Normalization.
- **Weighting Schemes:** Equal weights, Centroid weights, Regression-based weights, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), SMART, SMARTER, SWING.

## Key Features of COPRAS
- **Proportional Evaluation:** Evaluates alternatives proportionally according to their performance.
- **Beneficial and Non-beneficial Criteria:** Explicit differentiation enhances decision accuracy.
- **Relative Ranking:** Alternatives ranked based on relative performance against the best alternative.

## Advantages of COPRAS
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Handles beneficial and non-beneficial criteria explicitly.
- **Transparency:** Simple and clear calculation methods.
- **Versatility:** Suitable for diverse decision-making contexts.

## Disadvantages of COPRAS
- **Weight Dependency:** Results sensitive to subjective criteria weights.
- **Normalization Sensitivity:** Choice of normalization method can significantly impact outcomes.
- **Linearity Assumption:** Assumes linear proportionality, which might not reflect all real-world situations accurately.

| **Sensitivity**      | Sensitive to weights/normalization | Sensitive to weights/normalization    | Sensitive to weights/normalization   | Robust via threshold function           |

## When to Use COPRAS
- Problems with clear beneficial and non-beneficial criteria
- Situations requiring proportional evaluation of alternatives
- Decision contexts where additive utility methods are preferred

## Conclusion
COPRAS is an effective, transparent MCDA method particularly suitable for scenarios involving proportional contributions of both beneficial and non-beneficial criteria. Its straightforward approach facilitates practical decision-making but requires careful consideration of criteria weighting and normalization.
